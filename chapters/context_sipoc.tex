\chapter{SIPOC Analysis}

The SIPOC diagram provides a high-level overview of the Coffee Chain ERP process, highlighting how Suppliers, Inputs, Processes, Outputs, and Customers interact. It is a useful tool for understanding the flow of operations, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring that all stakeholdersâ€™ needs are addressed.

\section*{Purpose of SIPOC}
The SIPOC framework helps us visualize the end-to-end process of the Coffee Chain ERP system. It allows management to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify key suppliers and inputs required for smooth operations.
    \item Understand the critical processes that transform inputs into outputs.
    \item Ensure outputs meet the expectations of customers.
    \item Detect potential gaps or inefficiencies in the workflow.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Suppliers, Inputs, Processes, Outputs, Customers}

\subsection*{Suppliers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Coffee Outlets:} Provide sales data, menu updates, and operational feedback. They are the primary source of information for the ERP system.
    \item \textbf{Suppliers:} Supply raw ingredients, coffee beans, and other consumables. Timely delivery ensures smooth operations across outlets.
    \item \textbf{CRM:} Provides customer leads and engagement data, which is essential for marketing and sales tracking.
\end{itemize}
