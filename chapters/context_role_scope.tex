\section*{Role of the Coffee Chain ERP Module}

The Coffee Chain ERP module is designed to consolidate multiple business functions into a single, integrated platform. Its role is to streamline operations, improve data visibility, and provide actionable insights for decision-makers across the coffee outlet network. Specifically, the module serves the following purposes:

    \item \textbf{Outlet Management:} Maintain records of outlet details such as name, location, assigned manager, and regional manager. This ensures consistent operational oversight across all outlets.
    \item \textbf{Sales Management:} Capture daily sales transactions, link sales with menu products, track revenue per outlet, and generate performance reports.
    \item \textbf{CRM Integration:} Manage customer leads, track interactions, and associate them with sales outcomes to enhance customer relationship management.
    \item \textbf{Menu Integration:} Administer coffee menu items, categories, and pricing, with automatic synchronization to the Sales module for real-time ordering.
    \item \textbf{Data Consolidation and Analytics:} Centralize information from multiple outlets for analysis, reporting, and decision-making.
\end{itemize}
